            <p class="hiam">I am a 23 year old Argentinean guy, since 2020 I am living in Melbourne, Australia.
                I am studying a degree in Multimedia and Interaction Design at the Universidad Argentina de la Empresa (Buenos Aires, Argentina).
                Thanks to this and to my constant work contact with my colleagues, I expanded my knowledge and skills in design.
            </p>

            <div class="skills">

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>As a designer I have advanced knowledge in the use of Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Lightroom. Also, thanks to the university subjects, I have a basic knowledge of After Effects, Premiere, Adobe Audition and 3DS Max.
                    As for web design and web development, I have knowledge of XD, Sketch, Figma programs, among others, and HTML5 and CSS3.
                    Finally, I’m currently doing some basic PHP and JavaScript courses.</p>

                            BlackSnake (AUST) is a company that manufactures recovery strops for various industries, such as mining, 4WD, military, agricultural use, among others.

                            The objective was to create a platform where they could have their wide range of products and following the aesthetic guidelines intended by the client. Being products with double customisation axis (length and tonnage), the main problem was generated in the shop and how this double variable was going to be possible. Finally I was able to solve it by generating it from their API code and the site's database.</p>
